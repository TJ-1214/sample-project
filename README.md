# Starter for Jakarta EE

This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.

* You can build the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure that you have installed a [Java SE implementation](https://adoptium.net) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version (this sample assumes Java SE 8). Note that the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven installation is not actually required. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

  ```
  ./mvnw clean wildfly:dev
  ```

  This will automatically run in a development environment with hot reload.

* Java version must be 8 or higher.
* WildFly version: 26.1.3.Final
* Jakarta EE Web Profile 8
